-- BUGS --

1. add_comments function should be inside of update_comments function to reduce API calls

2. reduce_score_with_time - too much memory. 
   should be reduce_score_with_time(days_old=1)
             reduce_score_with_time(days_old=2)
             reduce_score_with_time(days_old=3)
             
             THIS WOULD reduce score for posts that are five days old or less 1 day at a time
